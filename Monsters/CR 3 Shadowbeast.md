The shadowbeast is created by a being who has delved too deeply into the mysteries of [[the Void]] and [[the Weave]], attempting to manipulate them for their own purposes. The process involves corrupting a normal animal with dark magic, causing it to mutate and become a shadowbeast. Shadowbeasts are often used as guardians or assassins by those who created them.
