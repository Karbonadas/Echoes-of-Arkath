**Death Gaze (1/day):** The Void Stalker targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the Void Stalker, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 35 (10d6) necrotic damage and be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Void Stalker's Death Gaze for the next 24 hours.
