These twisted creatures are the result of experiments carried out by [[The Cult of the Dark One]]. They were once human, but have been transformed into grotesque monsters with dark, mottled skin and razor-sharp claws. They are fiercely loyal to their creators and will stop at nothing to carry out their bidding.

**Actions**

**Multiattack.** The darkspawn makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

**Pounce.** If the darkspawn moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the darkspawn can make one additional claw attack against it as a bonus action.

**Infect.** The darkspawn can infect a creature it has grappled with its claws. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a virulent poison that deals 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The poison effect lasts for 1 hour, and the infected creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 14 (4d6) poison damage and the poison effect continues. The creature can also end the poison effect with a lesser restoration spell or similar magic.

**Corrupted Blood (1/Day).** The darkspawn can release a cloud of corrupted blood in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature that fails the save also gains one level of exhaustion.
