These undead monsters were once powerful warriors who were brought back from the dead through dark magic. They have a hulking, muscular form and are driven only by their desire to feed on the flesh of the living. They are chaotic evil and will attack any living creature they come across.

The Ghoul Brute is a formidable undead creature that retains some of its strength and combat skills from its previous life. However, its desire to feed on living flesh overrides any sense of honor or loyalty it may have had before death. It attacks without mercy and can paralyze its victims with its claws and bite.
