These once peaceful tree-creatures have been corrupted by dark magic. Their bark is black and their leaves are wilted and brown. They lash out at any living creatures that come too close, using their sharp branches to attack.

**False Appearance.** While the treant remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary tree.

**Magic Resistance.** The treant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Actions**

**Multiattack.** The treant makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 24 (4d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Entangle.** The treant causes roots and vines to sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square. For 1 minute, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength check, freeing itself on a success. The treant can use its action to uproot itself from its current location, causing the entangling plants to wither away.
