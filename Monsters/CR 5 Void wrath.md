These ghostly beings are created when a [[Voidcaller]]'s spell goes awry, infusing an unfortunate victim with the essence of the Void. They have a humanoid form, but their flesh is black and their eyes glow with a sickly green light. They can phase in and out of the physical plane, making them difficult to hit with weapons.

Ethereal Jaunt. The void wraith can move from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa, as a bonus action.

Incorporeal Movement. The void wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Shadow Step. The void wraith can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is in dim light or darkness.

Multiattack. The void wraith makes two claw attacks.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Phasing Strike (Recharge 5-6). The void wraith phases in and out of the physical plane, making a melee attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The attack deals an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn. If the void wraith is on the Ethereal Plane when it uses this ability, it immediately returns to the Material Plane after the attack.
