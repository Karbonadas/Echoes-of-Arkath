These ghostly creatures are born when a person dies with unresolved issues or emotions. They take on a spectral form and begin to roam the land, seeking out those who they believe can help them resolve their issues. However, their methods can be violent and deadly, as they will do whatever it takes to get what they want.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The soul harvester can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Actions**

**Life Drain.** Melee spell attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Soul Leech.** Ranged spell attack: +8 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (3d8 + 2) necrotic damage, and the soul harvester regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. If the target is killed by this attack, the soul harvester gains temporary hit points equal to the target's hit point maximum.

**Etherealness.** The soul harvester enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Ethereal Plane, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

**Tactics**

A soul harvester is a cunning predator that prefers to target individuals who are alone or separated from their allies. It uses its etherealness ability to move through walls and objects, making it difficult for its prey to escape. Once it has engaged its target, it uses its life drain ability to weaken them, and its soul leech ability to regain health. It will continue to pursue its target until it has either been killed or its issues have been resolved.
