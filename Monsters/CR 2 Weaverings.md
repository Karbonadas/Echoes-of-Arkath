These spider-like creatures are the result of magic experiments carried out by [[The Order of the Eternal Weave]] gone wrong. They have sharp claws and can spin webs imbued with dark energy that can ensnare their prey.

_**Web Walker.**_ The Weavering can move across any webbing as if it were normal terrain.

_**Web Sense.**_ While in contact with a web, the Weavering knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

_**Spider Claws.**_ Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the Weavering can't use its claws on another target.

_**Darkvision.**_ Accustomed to life underground, the Weavering has superior vision in dark and dim conditions. The creature can see in dim light within 60 feet of it as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

_**Vulnerable to Fire.**_ The Weavering takes double damage from fire damage.

The Weaverings are cunning and crafty hunters that spin webs imbued with dark energy to trap their prey. While not particularly strong, they are fast and agile, and can climb and move across webs with ease. Their webs can ensnare prey and make them easy targets for the Weaverings' sharp claws. However, they are vulnerable to fire damage, and a well-placed flame can quickly dispatch them.
