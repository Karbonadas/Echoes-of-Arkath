These small, chaotic neutral creatures are often mistaken for fireflies. However, they are actually tiny creatures that are capable of moving incredibly quickly and creating bursts of light that can disorient their prey. They are not always hostile, but can become aggressive if they feel threatened.

Innate Spellcasting: The Flicker can cast the cantrips Dancing Lights and Light at will, without requiring any material components.

Flicker Burst: Once per short rest, the Flicker can create a burst of light in a 15-foot radius that can disorient creatures caught within it. Creatures within the radius must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
