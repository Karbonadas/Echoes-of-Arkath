[[The Order of the Eternal Weave]]
The Weaveborn Sorcerers are individuals who have been touched by the raw magic that permeates the world, allowing them to tap into the magic of the Weave, the fabric of magic that holds the universe together. They are born with a natural affinity for magic, and their powers grow stronger as they learn to harness and control the magical energies around them.

**1st-Level Feature: Weaveborn Surge**  
When you choose this subclass at 1st level, you gain the ability to tap into the raw power of the Weave. Once per long rest, you can use your action to unleash a surge of chaotic magic. Roll on the Weaveborn Surge table to determine the effect, which can be beneficial, harmful, or simply strange.

**Weaveborn Surge Table(d20)** 

1.   Wild Flux - Your magic surges in a chaotic way, causing a random effect from the surge table. Roll twice and apply both effects.
    
2.  Arcane Overload - Your magic power overwhelms you, dealing 2d10 force damage to yourself and anyone within 5 feet of you.
    
3.  Uncontrollable Blink - You teleport to a random location within 30 feet of your current position.
    
4.  Weave Collapse - You temporarily lose control of your magic, causing a magical explosion in a 20-foot radius around you. All creatures within the radius take 2d8 force damage.
    
5.  Enchantment Burst - You gain advantage on the next Charisma-based ability check or attack roll you make.
    
6.  Transmutation Surge - Your physical form is altered in some way. Roll a d6: 1-2 - Your skin changes color. 3-4 - Your eyes change color. 5-6 - Your hair grows or falls out.
    
7.  Elemental Burst - You call forth the power of the elements, dealing 2d6 elemental damage (your choice of fire, cold, acid, or lightning) to a single target within 30 feet.
    
8.  Disruptive Wave - You cause a wave of energy to radiate out from you in a 10-foot radius, disrupting magical effects and forcing all creatures in the area to make a Wisdom saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute.
    
9.  Gravity Shift - You alter the gravitational pull in a 20-foot radius around you, causing all creatures in the area to make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
    
10.  Time Dilation - You slow down time around you, gaining an additional action on your turn.
    
11.  Spell Refraction - You reflect the next spell cast at you back at the caster.
    
12.  Weightless Step: For the next minute, you are immune to difficult terrain and your movement speed is increased by 10 feet. However, you also have disadvantage on any Strength-based checks or attacks.
    
13.  Chaos Bolt - You create a bolt of chaotic energy that deals 2d10 force damage to a single target within 60 feet.
    
14.  Invisibility - You become invisible for 1 minute or until you attack or cast a spell.

**6th-Level Feature: Wild Magic Affinity** 
Starting at 6th level, your connection to the Weave becomes even stronger, allowing you to more easily manipulate and control the chaotic energies of magic. You gain the following benefits:

-   When you roll on the Weaveborn Surge table, you can choose to roll twice and choose which result you want to use.
-   When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can choose to impose disadvantage on the saving throw. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**14th-Level Feature: Unpredictable Magic**  
At 14th level, your magic becomes even more unpredictable and chaotic. Whenever you roll on the Weaveborn Surge table, you can choose to roll an additional d10 and add the result to the effect. However, if you roll a 1 on the additional d10, the magic backfires and affects you instead of your intended target (if applicable).

**18th-Level Feature: Unstoppable Magic**  
At 18th level, your mastery over the Weave allows you to shrug off the effects of hostile magic. You gain the following benefits:

-   You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
-   Whenever you are affected by a spell or magical effect, you can use your reaction to roll on the Weaveborn Surge table and apply the result to the spell or effect. If the effect would normally allow a saving throw, the affected creature can make the saving throw as normal, with disadvantage if the result of the Weaveborn Surge table would impose it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
