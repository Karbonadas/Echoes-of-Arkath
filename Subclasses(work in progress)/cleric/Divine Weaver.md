[[The Order of the Eternal Weave]]
A cleric who specializes in weaving together the threads of fate and destiny, and manipulating the fabric of reality to serve their divine purpose.

Level 1 Feature: Threads of Fate As a bonus action, you can choose one creature within 30 feet of you and weave a thread of fate around them. The creature gains advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw they make within the next minute. Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Level 2 Feature: Weaver's Sight You gain darkvision up to a range of 60 feet, and you can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. In addition, you can use your action to detect the threads of fate around a creature. You learn if the creature is under the effect of a spell, curse, or other magical effect, and can sense the general nature of the effect.

Level 6 Feature: Entangled Fate You can target a creature that is affected by a spell, curse, or other magical effect, and attempt to sever its threads of fate. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature's magical effect ends immediately.

Level 8 Feature: Destined Strike You can channel the power of fate to strike a deadly blow against a creature. As a bonus action, you can choose one creature within 30 feet of you and make a weapon attack against it. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 2d6 radiant damage. Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Level 17 Feature: Master Weaver You have gained complete control over the threads of fate, and can manipulate them to achieve almost any effect. Once per day, you can cast the Wish spell without any of the negative consequences, as long as the wish is related to altering fate or destiny.
