The DC for setting a trap as a Forest Archer would depend on the complexity of the trap and the terrain it is set in. As a general guideline, a simple trap in an open area might have a DC of 12, while a complex trap in a heavily forested area might have a DC of 18 or higher.

For animal taming, the DC would depend on the temperament of the animal and its level of intelligence. A docile and intelligent creature, such as a wolf, might have a DC of 12, while a fierce and instinctual predator, such as a bear, might have a DC of 18 or higher. The Forest Archer's proficiency in Animal Handling and their Wisdom score would also affect the DC of the check.
