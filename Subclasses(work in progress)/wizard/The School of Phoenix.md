The School of Phoenix is a wizard subclass that emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge and the responsible use of magic for the betterment of society. Members of this school are highly educated and committed to the study of magic, with a particular focus on the mysteries of fire magic.

Level 2: Phoenix's Flame When you choose this subclass at 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue your spells with the fiery power of the phoenix. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can choose to spend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to add an extra 1d6 fire damage to the spell's damage. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at 14th level.

Level 6: Phoenix's Wisdom At 6th level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. In addition, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Charisma modifier for any Persuasion checks made to convince someone to share knowledge or secrets with you.

Level 10: Phoenix's Insight At 10th level, you gain the ability to read the intentions of others. As an action, you can make an Insight check contested by a creature's Deception check. If you succeed, you learn the creature's true intentions and any lies it may be telling. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses after finishing a long rest.

Level 14: Phoenix's Flame Mastery At 14th level, you gain mastery over fire magic. You can choose to cast any wizard spell that deals fire damage as if it were one level higher than it actually is. In addition, whenever you cast a wizard spell that deals fire damage, you can choose to spend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to maximize the damage dealt by the spell. If you do, the spell also ignites any flammable objects in its area of effect. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
