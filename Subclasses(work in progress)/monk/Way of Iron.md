The Way of Iron is a monastic tradition that emphasizes discipline and physical training above all else. Followers of this tradition believe that through rigorous training of both the body and the mind, they can become virtually indestructible in combat. They view themselves as the guardians of justice, and they seek to uphold their ideals through force of will and strength of arms.

Features:

1st level:

-   Iron Discipline: You gain proficiency in the Athletics skill. Additionally, you can use your bonus action to enter a state of Iron Discipline, granting you advantage on Strength checks and saves for 1 minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

3rd level:

-   Iron Fist: Your fists become deadly weapons. Your unarmed strikes now deal 1d6 damage instead of 1. Additionally, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can choose to spend 1 ki point to attempt to stun them. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

6th level:

-   Iron Will: You have trained your mind to resist mental assaults. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

11th level:

-   Iron Body: You have honed your body to a razor's edge. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

17th level:

-   Iron Immortality: You have reached a state of near-immortality through your training. Your body no longer ages, and you can no longer be killed by old age. Additionally, you gain resistance to all damage except psychic damage.

The Way of Iron is a formidable tradition that combines physical and mental training to create a warrior that is virtually indestructible. With their Iron Discipline, Iron Fist, Iron Will, Iron Body, and Iron Immortality, they are a force to be reckoned with.
