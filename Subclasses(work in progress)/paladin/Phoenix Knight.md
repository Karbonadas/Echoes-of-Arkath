A holy warrior devoted to the [[The Order of the Phoenix]], specializing in fire-based attacks and resurrection magic.

_Flame of the Phoenix:_ Starting at 1st level, you gain resistance to fire damage, and you can use your action to ignite a weapon you are holding, causing it to deal an additional 1d6 fire damage on a hit. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.

_Rise from Ashes:_ Starting at 1st level, if you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to expend a use of your Second Wind or Lay on Hands ability to immediately regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.

_Phoenix Presence:_ Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to project an aura of flame in a 30-foot radius centered on yourself. The aura lasts for 1 minute, and while it is active, any enemy that starts its turn within the aura or enters it for the first time on a turn takes 1d6 fire damage. In addition, you and your allies gain resistance to fire damage while within the aura.

_Phoenix Flight:_ Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to transform into a fiery phoenix once per long rest. While in phoenix form, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet and can hover. You can also use your action to create a burst of flames in a 20-foot radius around you, dealing 6d6 fire damage to creatures within the area (half damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw). You can remain in phoenix form for up to 10 minutes, or until you use an action to revert to your normal form.

_Phoenix Rebirth:_ Starting at 18th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and killed outright, you can choose to have your body burst into flames instead of falling unconscious. After 1 minute, you are reborn from the ashes with full hit points and all expended class resources restored. This feature can only be used once per long rest.
