A holy warrior devoted to the [[The Order of the Phoenix]], specializing in fire-based attacks and resurrection magic.

_Flame of the Phoenix:_ Starting at 1st level, you gain resistance to fire damage, and you can use your action to ignite a weapon you are holding, causing it to deal an additional 1d6 fire damage on a hit. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.

_Rise from Ashes:_ Starting at 1st level, if you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to expend a use of your Second Wind or Lay on Hands ability to immediately regain hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.

_Phoenix Presence:_ Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to project an aura of flame in a 30-foot radius centered on yourself. The aura lasts for 1 minute, and while it is active, any enemy that starts its turn within the aura or enters it for the first time on a turn takes 1d6 fire damage. In addition, you and your allies gain resistance to fire damage while within the aura.

_Phoenix Flight:_ Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to transform into a fiery phoenix once per long rest. While in phoenix form, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet and can hover. You can also use your action to create a burst of flames in a 20-foot radius around you, dealing 6d6 fire damage to creatures within the area (half damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw). You can remain in phoenix form for up to 10 minutes, or until you use an action to revert to your normal form.

_Phoenix Rebirth:_ Starting at 18th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and killed outright, you can choose to have your body burst into flames instead of falling unconscious. After 1 minute, you are reborn from the ashes with full hit points and all expended class resources restored. This feature can only be used once per long rest.



 
The Oath of Phoenix Knights is a solemn vow to uphold justice and protect the innocent, even at the cost of their own lives. This oath is taken by paladins who have been chosen by the Phoenix to be their champions, imbued with the spirit and power of the legendary bird.

The tenets of this oath include:

1.  Protection: The Phoenix Knight must protect the weak and innocent, even if it means sacrificing their own safety.
    
2.  Justice: The Phoenix Knight must uphold the law and punish those who would harm others.
    
3.  Valor: The Phoenix Knight must act with courage in the face of danger, never faltering in the pursuit of their duty.
    
4.  Mercy: The Phoenix Knight must show mercy to those who seek redemption, offering them a chance to atone for their sins.
    
5.  Loyalty: The Phoenix Knight must remain faithful to their allies and the cause of righteousness, never abandoning those in need.
    
6.  Self-Sacrifice: The Phoenix Knight must be willing to lay down their life for their cause or their comrades.
